# my_opencv_training_files
These are the OpenCV training files I created while studying Opencv.

In these files, there are some notes I wrote to remember what I did and why I did it this way. These notes are written in Turkish. 

Some video files that I use in my working codes have not been included here due to haven't enough storage space.

Except that, I'm continuing to study Opencv and I'll add more files in the future.
